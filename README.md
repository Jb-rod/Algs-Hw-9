Algorithm.py is an implementation of the block stacking problem described in documentation.pdf, in python 3.
You can run it by calling python3 Algorithm.py infile outfile
where the infile is the name of an input file whose
contents are in the following form: 

       3
       2 6 8
       4 4 4
       1 10 4

The first line specifies the number of block types.  Every other line 
specifies the dimension of a single block.

And outfile is the name of the file where the program will output the blocks in the optimal tower, in the same form as infile took its input.

Documentation.pdf contains a description of the problem, as well as a more detailled look at the specific implementation of the code.
